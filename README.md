# KuCoin CSV Exporter
Java application to export trades from KuCoin to a CSV file readable by CoinTracking.info. Code uses my own unofficial KuCoin Java API: https://github.com/coin-coop/kucoin-api. In future it will include withdrawals and deposits.

Use program on your own risk.

## Run

1. Run exe file
2. Insert your API and Secret Key (if you copy-paste - use Ctrl+V /Strg+V to paste it)
3. Choose location and name of the file for download
4. Press Download CSV and wait until all transactions are saved to file

## Security

After several complains by people about theoretical security issue, I advise that before you use application withdrawal your coins from KuCoin, next start application and download CSV trade history. After finishing remove API and Secret key which you have used for it.

If you don't trust prebuilt exe application feel free to build it by yourself. Run maven build with goal package:

´´´mvn clean package´´´
